Some threads handle adding and removing 
Each of these threads has their own array of data but also add to some universal data structure for matching
Each worker thread will also have its own memory pool
Other thread handle matching as a matching engine
Matching engine will have a priority queue by price and order ID along with the thread number
If an order is filled the matching engine will send a remove request to the respective worker thread
Matching engine will likely have 1 thread and the rest will be working threads
